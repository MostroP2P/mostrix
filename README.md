## Requirements:

0. You need Rust version 1.70 or higher to compile.

## Install dependencies:

To compile on Ubuntu/Pop!\_OS, please install [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then run the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential pkg-config
```

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostrix.git
$ cd mostrix
```

### Settings

Fill `settings.toml` file with you own settings before run it for the first time, Mostrix will copy it to `~/.mostrix`, after the first run you have to modify it directly in `~/.mostrix/settings.toml`

```toml
mostro_pubkey = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
