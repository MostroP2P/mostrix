# DM listener / router flow (`listen_for_order_messages`)

This document explains the runtime flow inside `listen_for_order_messages` (in `src/util/dm_utils/mod.rs`), focusing on:

- how the in-memory **message list** (`Vec<OrderMessage>`) is created/updated
- how “preferences”/routing concepts work: **TrackOrder**, **Waiter**, **Database**, **Action**, **Status**, notifications, and terminal cleanup

## Big picture

Mostrix has a **single background task** that:

- maintains relay subscriptions for **active orders** (long-lived)
- supports temporary **request/response waits** (short-lived) used by operations like “create order”, “take order”, “send msg”
- consumes incoming relay GiftWrap events and routes each event into:
  - (A) the **waiter path**: satisfy in-flight `wait_for_dm` calls
  - (B) the **tracked-order path**: update the UI/order-state pipeline

### Core state held by the listener

- **`subscribed_pubkeys: HashSet<PublicKey>`**  
  Pubkeys we believe we currently have an active GiftWrap subscription for (whether that subscription originated from TrackOrder or a Waiter).

- **`subscription_to_order: HashMap<SubscriptionId, (Uuid, i64)>`**  
  The “fast path” routing table: if an event arrives with a known `subscription_id`, we immediately know its `(order_id, trade_index)`.

- **`pubkey_to_subscription: HashMap<PublicKey, SubscriptionId>`**  
  Lets TrackOrder “rebind” a pubkey that was subscribed earlier by a waiter without subscribing twice.

- **`pending_waiters: Vec<PendingDmWaiter>`**  
  Each waiter is a oneshot sender plus the `trade_keys` to test whether the incoming GiftWrap can be decrypted for that operation.

- **`active_order_trade_indices: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<Uuid, i64>>>`** *(shared with the rest of the app)*  
  Tracks which orders are currently “active” and which `trade_index` (hence which trade key) belongs to each `order_id`.

- **`messages: Arc<Mutex<Vec<OrderMessage>>>`** *(shared with UI)*  
  The in-memory list backing the “Messages”/flow UI. Important: this vector is **not a full history**; it stores **one “latest relevant” row per order**.

## Startup bootstrap (subscriptions + relay replay)

### 1) Load active orders from the database

Before the listener task starts, `hydrate_startup_active_order_dm_state` (`src/util/dm_utils/mod.rs`) reads non-terminal orders from SQLite (`Order::get_startup_active_orders`) and builds:

- **`active_order_trade_indices`**: `order_id → trade_index` (seeds the shared `Arc<Mutex<…>>` used by the UI and listener)
- **`order_last_seen_dm_ts`**: optional per-order Unix cursor (max seen GiftWrap rumor time), used to choose the initial subscription filter

The in-memory **Messages** list (`Vec<OrderMessage>`) is **not** persisted. Only the DB row (trade keys, index, cursor) survives restart.

### 2) Per-order GiftWrap `subscribe` (routing tables)

`listen_for_order_messages` clones the active-order map and, for each `(order_id, trade_index)`:

1. derives `trade_keys` from the persisted `User` seed + trade index
2. subscribes via `dm_helpers::ensure_order_giftwrap_subscription` with a mode from `GiftWrapSubscriptionMode`:
   - **`StartupCatchUp`** (no `last_seen_dm_ts` yet): latest retained event (`limit(1)`) — tight catch-up
   - **`StartupSince(ts)`** (cursor present): `since(ts)` for incremental subscription
   - **`LiveOnly`** (used after `TrackOrder` during live flows, e.g. take-order): **`.limit(0)`** live stream — **not** `.since(now)`, so Same-second Mostro replies are not dropped when `take_order` sends an early `TrackOrder` before `wait_for_dm` (the pubkey is already subscribed once; a second waiter subscription is skipped)
3. records routing metadata (`subscribed_pubkeys`, `subscription_to_order`, `pubkey_to_subscription`)

### 3) One-shot `fetch_events` replay (Messages tab after restart)

Relay subscriptions alone often **do not** deliver enough stored history into the notification stream to refill the UI. Immediately after the bootstrap `subscribe` loop, the listener runs **`fetch_and_replay_startup_trade_dms`**:

- Builds a **`DmListenerStartupReplay`** struct (same locals as the main loop: `client`, `pool`, `user`, `messages`, notification maps, subscription maps).
- For each startup order with a known subscription id, **queries relays** with `client.fetch_events` (GiftWrap, trade pubkey, ~30-day lookback, capped batch size).
- Sorts events by `created_at`, decrypts, `parse_dm_events`, then **`dispatch_giftwrap_batch`** with **`notify: false`** so historical replay does not bump the unread badge or re-trigger invoice popups.
- Live relay notifications still use **`notify: true`**.

**Practical “where to look”**: `fetch_and_replay_startup_trade_dms`, `DmListenerStartupReplay`, and the `notify` parameter on `handle_trade_dm_for_order` / `dispatch_giftwrap_batch` in `src/util/dm_utils/mod.rs`.

## Command “preferences”: TrackOrder vs Waiter

The listener consumes a command channel (`dm_subscription_rx`) with two variants:

### 1) `TrackOrder { order_id, trade_index }`

Use case: “this order is now active; keep listening for updates”.

What happens:

- **Active order map is updated immediately** (`active_order_trade_indices.insert(order_id, trade_index)`)
  - It also removes any “stale” `order_id` entries pointing at the same `trade_index` (to avoid phantom order IDs when the final Mostro-provided ID differs from an optimistic one).
- Derive `trade_keys` from `trade_index`, get `pubkey = trade_keys.public_key()`.
- Ensure a GiftWrap subscription exists for that pubkey. If already subscribed (possibly via a waiter), TrackOrder will reuse it.
- Update routing tables so future relay events with that `subscription_id` are routed directly to `(order_id, trade_index)`.

**Conceptually:** TrackOrder is long-lived; it binds the pubkey to a concrete order and makes the tracked-order path reliable and O(1).

### 2) `RegisterWaiter { trade_keys, response_tx }`

Use case: “I’m about to send a request DM; wait for the first decryptable response for these trade keys”.

What happens:

- Waiters are bounded (`MAX_PENDING_WAITERS`), and periodically garbage-collected (drops closed oneshots).
- If this trade pubkey is not yet subscribed, the listener subscribes to GiftWrap events for it and records the `SubscriptionId` in `pubkey_to_subscription`.
- The waiter subscription uses a **live-only GiftWrap filter** (`.limit(0)`), which avoids
  replay backlog and prevents missing immediate responses due to same-second `since(now)` cutoff.
- The waiter is pushed into `pending_waiters`.

**Conceptually:** a Waiter is short-lived. It does not know `order_id`; it only knows “this key should decrypt the response”.

## Incoming GiftWrap event routing (the heart of the flow)

When a relay event arrives (`RelayPoolNotification::Event`) and `event.kind == GiftWrap`:

### Step A — satisfy pending waiters first

For each waiter:

- test whether `nip59::extract_rumor(&waiter.trade_keys, &event)` succeeds
- if it does, send the raw `event` into the waiter oneshot (`response_tx.send(event.clone())`)
- otherwise, keep the waiter pending for the next event

To avoid duplicate decrypt checks, the listener keeps a **per-event decryptability cache**:

- key: `(event_id, trade_pubkey)`
- value: `bool` (decryptable or not)

This cache is reused again in the tracked-order path below.

### Step B — tracked-order path (map event → order_id/trade_index)

The listener tries, in order:

1) **Fast path: route by subscription id**  
If `subscription_to_order` contains `subscription_id`, we have `(order_id, trade_index)`.

2) **Fallback path: resolve by testing active orders**  
If subscription id is unknown (e.g. a waiter created the subscription and TrackOrder hasn’t rebound it yet), the listener scans `active_order_trade_indices` and tries decrypting the event against each derived trade key until one matches.

When an `(order_id, trade_index, trade_keys)` is found, the listener proceeds to parse and dispatch.

## How the “list of messages” is created

### 1) Decrypt & parse into protocol `Message`

For the tracked order (or fallback-resolved order), the listener:

- builds a one-event `Events` set
- calls `parse_dm_events(events, &trade_keys, None)`

`parse_dm_events` returns a sorted list:

- **dedup**: drops duplicate Nostr event IDs
- **decrypt**: unwraps GiftWrap (NIP-59) and parses JSON into `mostro_core::Message`
- **sort**: ascending by rumor created-at timestamp (oldest → newest)

### 2) Dispatch each parsed trade DM into the UI/DB pipeline

For each `(Message, timestamp, sender)` in the parsed batch:

- call `handle_trade_dm_for_order(...)`
- then apply “terminal trade” cleanup rules (see below)

### 3) `handle_trade_dm_for_order` constructs (and replaces) `OrderMessage`

This function is where `OrderMessage` is created/updated and pushed into `messages`.

Key behaviors:

- **DB refresh/upsert for certain actions**  
  For `add-invoice` and `pay-invoice` where the payload embeds an order, the listener persists/upserts the order row (including request id when available).

- **Status persistence**  
  Updates the order status in SQLite via `update_order_status` using:
  - status derived from `Payload::Order` / `PaymentRequest(Some(order), ...)` + `map_action_to_status`, or
  - action-only inference (`inferred_status_from_trade_action`) when payload is absent.

- **Derive “effective” UI fields with fallbacks**  
  The `OrderMessage` fields like `sat_amount`, `buyer_invoice`, `order_kind`, `is_mine`, `order_status` are computed from a priority order:
  - payload (if present)
  - database row (if present)
  - previous message already stored for that order (if present)

- **Dedup / “is new message” logic**  
  Relay delivery can be out-of-order. The listener decides a message is “new” if:
  - there was no existing message for that order, or
  - the `Action` changed, or
  - the `Action` is the same but the new timestamp is strictly newer

- **“One row per order” storage**  
  The `messages: Vec<OrderMessage>` is treated as “latest per order”:
  - it removes any existing entry with the same `order_id`
  - pushes the newly created `OrderMessage`
  - sorts the whole vector by `timestamp` descending (newest first)

So the “message list” is really a **per-order summary row list**, not a chat transcript.

### 4) Notifications + pending badge count

If the update is both:

- **actionable** (e.g. `pay-invoice` only when an actual invoice exists), and
- **new** (per the logic above),

then the listener:

- increments `pending_notifications`
- sends a UI notification via `message_notification_tx`

## Action vs Status vs Database (how to think about them)

- **`Action`** (`mostro_core::Action`)  
  The *event type* of a protocol step (e.g. `PayInvoice`, `AddInvoice`, `FiatSent`, `Release`, `Canceled`, …). This is always present in the decoded `MessageKind`.

- **`Status`** (`mostro_core::order::Status`)  
  The order’s *state machine position* (e.g. `waiting-payment`, `active`, `fiat-sent`, `success`, …). This may come from:
  - an embedded order payload (`Payload::Order` or `PaymentRequest(Some(order), ...)`)
  - the local DB (previously persisted)
  - inference from certain action-only messages

- **Database (`sqlite`)**  
  Used to persist “critical truth” for recovery and UI:
  - order rows (including `trade_keys`, kind, mine/not-mine, last known status)
  - status updates (`update_order_status`)
  - “upsert from DM” updates for invoice-related actions

**Rule of thumb in the listener:**  
Use payload `Status` when present, otherwise consult DB or infer from `Action`, then publish an `OrderMessage` that carries “effective” fields forward so the UI stays stable even across partial payloads.

## Terminal cleanup (when we stop tracking an order)

Some messages indicate the trade is over. Terminal detection considers:

- explicit terminal actions even when payload is null (e.g. `canceled`)
- terminal order statuses when present in the payload (`success`, `canceled`, `expired`, …)

When a terminal message is detected:

- for **tracked subscriptions** (known `subscription_id`):
  - remove the order from `active_order_trade_indices`
  - remove the pubkey from `subscribed_pubkeys`
  - remove the mapping entry from `subscription_to_order`
  - unsubscribe from the relay subscription

- for **fallback/untracked** (unknown `subscription_id`):
  - remove the order from `active_order_trade_indices`
  - remove the pubkey from `subscribed_pubkeys`
  - do **not** unsubscribe (we may not own that subscription id)
